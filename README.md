First "re-learning" python project. 

Run the "imperialMetricConverter.py" to use the program.

Things to add/change:
1. Add more conversions as I come up with them
2. Make things nicer/fit python conventions
3. Make things more efficient as I learn more
4. Make GUI
5. Make into executable
6. Continue to check boundary conditions of inputs
